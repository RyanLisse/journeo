# 🌟 Journeo: Learning Java in Public 🌟

## 📝 Description

Welcome to **Journeo**! 🚀 This project is all about deepening my understanding of Java fundamentals and data structures through project-based learning. 📚 This repository serves as my public diary 📖, showcasing my progress, challenges, and achievements as I dive into the world of Java. 🌍

## 🎯 Features

- **🛠 Java Fundamentals**: Exercises and examples to get the hang of Java basics.
- **🔗 Data Structures**: Implementations of key data structures like Linked Lists, Hash Tables, and Binary Trees.
- **🔍 Algorithms**: Sorting and searching algorithms implemented in Java.
- **🏗 Project-Based Learning**: Real-world projects like the Supermarket Checkout Pricer to apply what I've learned.
- **🤖 AI Integration**: Incorporating AI algorithms in projects for that extra flair.

## 🎓 Objectives

1. **🌐 Learning in Public**: To transparently share my learning journey, the good and the bad. 🌈
2. **📈 Deepen Understanding**: To really get Java fundamentals and data structures. 🎯
3. **🛠 Project-Based Learning**: To put theory into practice with real-world projects. 🏗
4. **🤖 AI Integration**: To dabble in the integration of AI in Java projects. 🤓

## 🗓 Daily Goals

The project is developed in a two-week sprint 🗓, dedicating 4 hours daily to Java fundamentals and data structures ⏳, and another 4 hours to project development 🛠. Each day aims to achieve specific objectives, which are tracked using this GitHub project board 📊.
